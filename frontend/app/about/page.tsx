      <p>
        GutSense is an AI-powered educational tool that predicts digestive health patterns using
        everyday indicators like food intake, hydration, stress, and stool characteristics.
        The system is based on <strong>Machine Learning prediction</strong> and uses medically
        recognized references such as the Bristol Stool (Bristol Stool Chart) scale for awareness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Digestive health impacts overall well-being, but early signs are often ignored.
        GutSense bridges this awareness gap by providing <strong>ML-driven, non-diagnostic predictions</strong>
        to promote healthier habits and timely medical consultation when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project does <strong>not</strong> offer medical diagnosis or treatment.
        It encourages informed decisions and responsible AI deployment.
