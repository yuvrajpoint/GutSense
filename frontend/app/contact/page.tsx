      <p>Hello! 👋 This is ReturnZero, the creator of GutSense.</p>

      <p>
        This project was built with the intention of exploring how machine
        learning can be applied responsibly in healthcare contexts, especially
        where awareness and early guidance can make a meaningful difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        GutSense combines medical knowledge, ethical AI principles, and
        full-stack development to demonstrate how technology can support — not
        replace — human decision-making in health.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have feedback, ideas, or would like to collaborate on research or
        development, feel free to reach out.<br></br>👉👈
